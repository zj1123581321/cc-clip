# cc-clip

Paste images into remote Claude Code over SSH — as if it were local.

## The Problem

When running Claude Code on a remote server via SSH, `Ctrl+V` image paste doesn't work.
The remote `xclip` reads the server's clipboard, not your local Mac's clipboard.

## The Solution

cc-clip creates a transparent bridge between your local clipboard and the remote server:

```
Local Mac clipboard  -->  SSH tunnel  -->  xclip shim  -->  Claude Code
```

No changes to Claude Code. No terminal-specific hacks. Just works.

## Quick Start

**1. Install locally (Mac):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shunmei/cc-clip/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**2. Start the daemon and connect:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local clipboard daemon
cc-clip serve

# Terminal 2: Deploy to your remote server
cc-clip connect myserver
```

**3. Add SSH port forwarding** (if not already configured):

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host myserver
    RemoteForward 18339 127.0.0.1:18339
```

> **Important:** If you use `ControlMaster` for SSH connection multiplexing, see [Troubleshooting — SSH ControlMaster](#ssh-controlmaster-breaks-remoteforward) below.

**4. Done.** `Ctrl+V` in remote Claude Code now pastes images from your Mac.

## How It Works

1. **Local daemon** (`cc-clip serve`) — Reads your Mac clipboard, serves images via HTTP on `127.0.0.1:18339`
2. **SSH tunnel** (`RemoteForward`) — Forwards the daemon port to the remote server
3. **xclip shim** — Intercepts only the clipboard calls Claude Code makes, fetches image data through the tunnel, passes everything else to the real `xclip`

### Security

- Daemon listens on loopback only (`127.0.0.1`)
- Session-scoped token with TTL (default 12h)
- Token transmitted via stdin, not command-line arguments
- All non-shim calls pass through to real `xclip` unchanged

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cc-clip serve` | Start local clipboard daemon |
| `cc-clip connect <host>` | Deploy to remote server (one command) |
| `cc-clip install` | Install xclip shim on remote |
| `cc-clip uninstall` | Remove xclip shim |
| `cc-clip paste` | Manually fetch clipboard image (fallback) |
| `cc-clip doctor` | Local health check |
| `cc-clip doctor --host H` | End-to-end health check |
| `cc-clip status` | Show component status |

## Configuration

All settings have sensible defaults. Override via flags or environment variables:

| Setting | Default | Env Var |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Port | 18339 | `CC_CLIP_PORT` |
| Token TTL | 12h | `CC_CLIP_TOKEN_TTL` |
| Output dir | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/claude-images` | `CC_CLIP_OUT_DIR` |
| Probe timeout | 500ms | `CC_CLIP_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| Fetch timeout | 5000ms | `CC_CLIP_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| Debug logs | off | `CC_CLIP_DEBUG=1` |

## Requirements

**Local (Mac):**
- macOS 13+
- `pngpaste` (`brew install pngpaste`)
- `curl`

**Remote (Linux):**
- `xclip` (`sudo apt install xclip`) — the shim wraps it; the real binary must exist as fallback
- `curl` (for shim HTTP calls)
- `bash` (shim is a bash script)
- `~/.local/bin` in `PATH` (must have higher priority than `/usr/bin`)
- SSH access with `RemoteForward` capability

## Platform Support

| Local | Remote | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| macOS (arm64/amd64) | Linux (amd64/arm64) | GA |

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostics

```bash
# Check everything at once
cc-clip doctor --host myserver

# Enable debug logging on the shim
ssh myserver 'CC_CLIP_DEBUG=1 xclip -selection clipboard -t TARGETS -o'
```

### Step-by-Step Verification

If image paste isn't working, run these checks **in order** to isolate the problem:

```bash
# 1. Local: Is the daemon running?
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18339/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# 2. Remote: Is the tunnel forwarding?
ssh myserver "curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18339/health"
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# 3. Remote: Is the shim taking priority over real xclip?
ssh myserver "which xclip"
# Expected: /home/<user>/.local/bin/xclip  (NOT /usr/bin/xclip)

# 4. Remote: Does the shim intercept correctly? (copy an image on Mac first)
ssh myserver 'CC_CLIP_DEBUG=1 xclip -selection clipboard -t TARGETS -o'
# Expected: image/png
```

### SSH ControlMaster Breaks RemoteForward

**Symptom:** `cc-clip connect` reports "tunnel verified", but the tunnel doesn't work in your interactive SSH session. `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18339/health` hangs on the remote.

**Cause:** If you use SSH `ControlMaster auto` (connection multiplexing), the first SSH connection becomes the "master". All subsequent connections **reuse the master** — even if you later add `RemoteForward` to your config. The old master connection does not have the port forwarding, so the tunnel silently fails.

`ssh -O exit` to kill the master often doesn't help because the control socket hash (`%C`) may differ between sessions.

**Fix:** Disable `ControlMaster` for hosts that use `RemoteForward`:

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host myserver
    HostName 10.x.x.x
    User myuser
    RemoteForward 18339 127.0.0.1:18339
    ControlMaster no
    ControlPath none
```

This ensures every SSH connection creates a fresh tunnel. The trade-off is slightly slower connection setup (no multiplexing), but it guarantees `RemoteForward` works reliably.

**Alternatively**, if you want to keep `ControlMaster` for other hosts, ensure it's only disabled for this specific host, while keeping the global `Host *` setting for others.

### Daemon Restart Invalidates Token

**Symptom:** "fetch type failed" or "token invalid" in shim debug logs.

**Cause:** Each time `cc-clip serve` starts, it generates a **new token**. The remote server still has the old token from the previous session.

**Fix:** Re-run `cc-clip connect <host>` after every daemon restart to sync the new token.

**Tip:** Run the daemon in the background so it survives terminal closes:

```bash
nohup cc-clip serve > /tmp/cc-clip.log 2>&1 &
```

### Remote `xclip` Not Installed

**Symptom:** Shim debug log shows `/usr/bin/xclip: No such file or directory`.

**Cause:** The shim needs the real `xclip` binary as a fallback for non-image clipboard operations (e.g., text paste).

**Fix:**

```bash
sudo apt install xclip    # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install xclip    # RHEL/CentOS
```

Then re-run `cc-clip connect <host>` to re-detect the real binary path.

### `~/.local/bin` Not in PATH

**Symptom:** `cc-clip connect` shows WARNING: `'which xclip' resolves to /usr/bin/xclip, not ~/.local/bin/xclip`.

**Cause:** The shim is installed to `~/.local/bin/` but it's not first in PATH, so the system uses `/usr/bin/xclip` instead.

**Fix:** Add to your remote `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Verify with `which xclip` — it should point to `~/.local/bin/xclip`.

### Empty Image Data (API Error 400)

**Symptom:** Claude Code returns `API Error: 400 — image cannot be empty`. The conversation becomes corrupted and all subsequent image pastes fail in the same session.

**Cause:** A race condition where the clipboard content changes between the TARGETS check and the image fetch. The daemon returns HTTP 204 (No Content), but `curl -sf` treats 2xx as success and writes 0 bytes. The shim outputs empty data, and Claude Code sends an empty base64 image to the API.

**Fix:** This was fixed in [cc6b0b2](https://github.com/ShunmeiCho/cc-clip/commit/cc6b0b2). The shim now checks that downloaded data is non-empty before returning success. If you hit this error:

1. In Claude Code, run `/clear` or start a new session (the old conversation is corrupted)
2. Update to the latest cc-clip and re-run `cc-clip connect <host>`

### No Image in Clipboard

**Symptom:** Shim returns `image/png` for TARGETS but Claude Code says "No image found in clipboard".

**Cause:** You may not have an image in your Mac clipboard. The shim falls back to real `xclip` which reads the remote server's (empty) clipboard.

**Fix:** Copy an image on your Mac first:
- **Screenshot to clipboard:** `Cmd + Shift + Ctrl + 4` (select area) or `Cmd + Shift + Ctrl + 3` (full screen)
- **Copy from an app:** Right-click an image → Copy Image

## Known Limitations

The following are known pain points that we plan to improve iteratively:

| Issue | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Token re-sync on daemon restart | Every `cc-clip serve` restart generates a new token, requiring a full `cc-clip connect` to re-sync | ✅ Fixed — token persistence with TTL, `--token-only` flag |
| Full redeploy on every `connect` | `connect` re-compiles and re-uploads the binary even when only the token changed | ✅ Fixed — incremental deploy with hash-based skip |
| SSH passphrase prompted multiple times | `connect` makes multiple SSH calls internally, each prompting for passphrase | ✅ Fixed — SSH ControlMaster session reuse |
| Remote PATH not auto-configured | `connect` detects `~/.local/bin` not in PATH but doesn't fix it automatically | ✅ Fixed — auto-detect shell and inject PATH marker |
| No daemon auto-start | Daemon runs in foreground; `nohup` is a workaround, no launchd/systemd integration yet | ✅ Fixed — `cc-clip service install` for macOS launchd |
